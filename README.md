# Hypnohub_downloader

A pretty efficient scrapper for hypnohub.net, with support for threaded downloading, and downloading of deleted posts  
**USE `v1_patched.py`, it's the only one that works!**

## How to use:
- Make sure you have python installed (you can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Make sure all the requirements from requirements.txt are installed. to do that, use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in the same folder as the requirements.txt file.  
Alternatively, just use the `pip install regex requests` command in a CMD
- optional: you can edit some of the config of the script in the .py file, just open it in something like notepad  
Keep in mind `True` and `False` start with a capital letter
- Run the script by double clicking on the .py file
